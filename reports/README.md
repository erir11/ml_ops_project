# Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations

This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:

```--- question 1 fill here ---```

Where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is
auto-generated at the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image
to the `figures` subfolder (please only use `.png`, `.jpg` or `.jpeg`) and then add the following code in your answer:

```markdown
![my_image](figures/<image>.<extension>)
```

In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the `report.py` script that provides two utility functions:

Running:

```bash
python report.py html
```

Will generate a `.html` page of your report. After the deadline for answering this template, we will auto-scrape
everything in this `reports` folder and then use this utility to generate a `.html` page that will be your serve
as your final hand-in.

Running

```bash
python report.py check
```

Will check your answers in this template against the constraints listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, or have you included an image when asked. For both functions to work you mustn't rename anything.
The script has two dependencies that can be installed with

```bash
pip install typer markdown
```

## Overall project checklist

The checklist is *exhaustive* which means that it includes everything that you could do on the project included in the

### Question 3
> **A requirement to the project is that you include a third-party package not covered in the course. What framework**
> **did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the*
> *package to do ... and ... in our project*.
>
> Answer: We used the Albumentations library in our project to perform data augmentation on images. By using functionalities such as RandomResizedCrop, HorizontalFlip, GaussNoise, GaussianBlur, and OpticalDistortion, we generated a wide variety of transformations to enhance model robustness. These operations helped us randomly crop images, flip them horizontally, introduce noise, and even distort them with grid-based or optical manipulations.

> Torch metrics was used to get the F1 score, which captures both precision and recall in a single measure, making it especially useful for imbalanced datasets.

## Coding environment

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment. This includes
> how you managed dependencies, the structure of your code and how you managed code quality.

### Question 4

> **Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go**
> **through to get an exact copy of your environment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a*
> *complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands*
>
> Answer:

We used conda for managing our dependencies, with pip handling additional Python packages. Our `environment.yaml` defines a structured environment with:
- Core Python 3.11 installation
- Package sources from conda-forge and defaults channels
- Essential build tools (setuptools, pip)
- Additional dependencies managed through requirements files

To get a complete copy of our development environment, one would have to run the following commands:

```bash
# Create and activate conda environment from yaml specification
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ml_ops_project
```

This ensures all team members have identical development environments with the same package versions and development tools installed, with proper Python path configuration.


### Question 5

> **We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your**
> **code. What did you fill out? Did you deviate from the template in some way?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words
>
> Example:
> *From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder*
> *because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our*
> *experiments.*
>
> Answer:

From the [MLOps template](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/mlops_template) we have filled the src, tests, configs, data, dockerfiles, reports and models folders. We did not see any need for notebooks, so we deleted that folder. Inside the src folder we split the data script into a `prepare_data.py` and a `data.py`script. Further we did not use the visualize script so we also deleted that one. We the `evaluate.py` script was replace with a `predict.py` script. This was done because our training script also evaluates the model (through the pytorch-lightning Trainer module). In the tests folder we filled in pytests for the model, data and api.


### Question 6

> **Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? What about typing and documentation? Additionally,**
> **explain with your own words why these concepts matters in larger projects.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used ... for linting and ... for formatting. We also used ... for typing and ... for documentation. These*
> *concepts are important in larger projects because ... . For example, typing ...*
>
> Answer:

We used ruff for linting and formatting with specific rule selections (E, F, I) covering error detection, flake8 rules and import sorting. Our ruff configuration enforces line lengths of 120 characters (which is a bit more than the standard PEP 8 recommendation) and excludes common directories like .git, build, and dist. Throughout the project, we strived to maintain consistent use of Python type hints to improve code clarity and catch type-related errors early. For documentation, we made an effort to include descriptive docstrings for our functions and classes, particularly in core modules like prepare_data and predict.
These practices are vital in larger projects for several key reasons:

1. Consistent formatting makes code reviews more efficient and helps new team members adapt quickly

2. Type hints serve as live documentation of expected inputs and outputs, catching potential errors before runtime

3. Docstrings and clear documentation reduce onboarding time and make the codebase more maintainable

The importance of these tools became evident in our daily workflow - code reviews focused on logic rather than style issues, and type hints helped prevent type-related bugs during development.

## Version control

> In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
> corporate and increase the quality of your code.

### Question 7

> **How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our*
> *application but also ... .*
>
> Answer:

In our continuous effort to ensure the reliability of our machine learning pipeline, we have expanded our testing suite. Currently, there are a total of 22 tests implemented across three primary test files:

1. Data Pipeline Testing (`test_data.py`):
   - Dataset initialization and validation
   - Data loading and transformations
   - Error handling for corrupted/missing data
   - DataModule functionality, including batch processing
   - Image transformations and preprocessing

2. Model Testing (`test_model.py`):
   - Model initialization
   - Forward pass functionality
   - Training and validation steps
   - Optimizer and scheduler configuration
   - Output shape verification across different batch sizes

3. API Endpoint Testing (`test_api.py`):
   - Root endpoint accessibility
   - Predictions for valid and invalid image inputs
   - Error handling and message validation

These tests are critical for ensuring robust data handling and model behavior, which are vital for the reliability of our machine learning pipeline. Particularly, the data pipeline testing helps identify data issues that are often sources of training problems.

### Question 8

> **What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If your code had a code coverage of 100% (or close**
> **to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our **
> *code and even if we were then...*
>
> Answer:

Based on our coverage report, our total code coverage is 38%, which is relatively low. However, this is to be expected, as we did not implement test for all crucial parts of our codebase.

- Data handling has good coverage (85%): data.py
- Model implementation has moderate coverage (63%): model.py
- Three critical modules have 0% coverage: predict.py, prepare_data.py, and train.py

Even if we achieved 100% code coverage, we would not consider the code completely error-free.

1. Code coverage only measures which lines of code are executed during tests, not the quality or comprehensiveness of those tests

2. Edge cases and real-world scenarios might not be captured even with full line coverage

3. Integration issues between components might still exist even if individual units are fully tested

4. Certain types of errors like race conditions, memory leaks, or performance issues might not be detected by unit tests

5. Business logic errors could still exist even if the code executes without technical errors

### Question 9

> **Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and**
> **pull request can help improve version control.**

### Question 11

> **Discuss you continuous integration setup. What kind of continuous integration are you running (unittesting,**
> **linting, etc.)? Do you test multiple operating systems, Python  version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free**
> **to insert a link to one of your GitHub actions workflow.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 200-300 words.

> Example:
> *We have organized our continuous integration into 3 separate files: one for doing ..., one for running ... testing*
> *and one for running ... . In particular for our ..., we used ... .An example of a triggered workflow can be seen*
> *here: <weblink>*
>
> Answer:

Our continuous integration is organized into two main GitHub Actions workflows plus automated dependency management. The first workflow runs pre-commit checks for code quality, using hooks for basic file validation and Ruff for both linting and formatting. It automatically fixes and commits minor issues.
The second workflow handles unit testing across multiple operating systems (Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS) using a matrix strategy. It implements pip caching to speed up builds and uses coverage.py for test coverage reporting. Dependencies are managed through GitHub's Dependabot, which automatically creates pull requests for updates to both pip packages and GitHub Actions on a monthly schedule.

An example of a triggered workflow can be seen [here](https://github.com/erir11/ml_ops_project/actions/runs/12827966987).

## Running code and tracking experiments

> In the following section we are interested in learning more about the experimental setup for running your code and
> especially the reproducibility of your experiments.

### Question 12

> **How did you configure experiments? Did you make use of config files? Explain with coding examples of how you would**
> **run a experiment.**
>
> Recommended answer length: 50-100 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used a simple argparser, that worked in the following way: Python  my_script.py --lr 1e-3 --batch_size 25*
>
> Answer:

For configuring and running experiments, we used Hydra and OmegaConf for managing configuration files. These allow easy management of parameters through configuration files, enhancing reproducibility and modularity.

```python
import hydra
from omegaconf import DictConfig

@hydra.main(config_path="configs", config_name="config")
def main(cfg: DictConfig) -> None:
    print("Experiment Configuration:")
    print(OmegaConf.to_yaml(cfg))
    # Experiment here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The configuration file (`config.yaml`) contains all the parameters such as model type, learning rates, and data paths. Here's a snippet from the one we used for training:

```yaml
seed: 42
data:
  data_dir: "../../../data/processed"
  batch_size: 32
  image_size: [256, 256]
model:
  name: "resnet50"
  learning_rate: 2e-5
trainer:
  max_epochs: 20
logger:
  wandb:
    project: "car-damage-classification"
```

Hydra simplifies experiment configuration by automatically overriding the defaults with specified values, enabling seamless experiment management.

### Question 13

> **Reproducibility of experiments are important. Related to the last question, how did you secure that no information**
> **is lost when running experiments and that your experiments are reproducible?**
>
> Recommended answer length: 100-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We made use of config files. Whenever an experiment is run the following happens: ... . To reproduce an experiment*
> *one would have to do ...*
>
> Answer:

To ensure our experiments were reproducible and no information was lost, we used Hydra for configuration management. This allowed us to maintain all experiment settings, like model type and hyperparameters, in clear config files. Each time an experiment runs, Hydra logs the settings, making it easy to replicate the setup.

We also used Weights & Biases (wandb) for tracking our experiments. Wandb logged metrics, parameters, and saved models during training. This ensures that all crucial details of the experiment are stored and can be accessed later.

We saved all outputs, including logs and checkpoints, in an 'outputs' folder. This approach ensured that all data generated during the experiment is kept. To reproduce an experiment, one simply need to check the config files logged by Hydra and retrieve stored data from wandb or the outputs directory.

### Question 14

> **Upload 1 to 3 screenshots that show the experiments that you have done in W&B (or another experiment tracking**
> **service of your choice). This may include loss graphs, logged images, hyperparameter sweeps etc. You can take**
> **inspiration from [this figure](figures/wandb.png). Explain what metrics you are tracking and why they are**

>
> Recommended answer length: 50-200 words.
>
> Example:
> *We used the following two services: Engine and Bucket. Engine is used for... and Bucket is used for...*
>
> Answer:

We used the following GCP services:

Artifact Registry: Stores and manages our Docker container images for both training and API deployment. It provides secure, private storage for our containers with built-in vulnerability scanning.

Cloud Run: Hosts our FastAPI application for model inference. It provides serverless deployment of containers, automatically scaling based on demand and only charging for actual usage.

Secret Manager: Securely stores sensitive information like our W&B API key. It provides centralized management of secrets with version control and fine-grained access control.

Vertex AI: Manages our model training jobs with custom containers. It provides a managed environment for ML training with features like job monitoring, logging, and resource management.

Cloud Storage (Bucket): Provides object storage where we kept our datasets. It allowed for scalable, durable storage of files and integrates easily with version control tools like DVC.
